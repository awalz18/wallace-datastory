	<h1>Technology as a Distraction for Writers</h1>
	<img src="assets/img/croissant.jpg" alt="Croissant">
	<p>I am a writer. I spend my mornings at a coffee shop writing poems, prayers, and short stories. I am a Creative Writing/Literature and Language double major, so my classes are full of writing. I spend my afternoons and evenings finishing essays, journaling, and writing 'to do' lists for the following day. <i>I am in love with words</i>, but being a writer in the 21st century poses quite the challenge.</p>
	<p>Living in a society where technology demands attention, dictates our lives, and continuously advances is distracting for everyone, but as a writer, I have grown increasingly frustrated by my inability to finish a journal entry in less than 30 minutes <i>just</i> because Facebook notifications keep popping up on my phone. </p>
	<p>I did a small, introspective data project in which I counted the number of times I checked Facebook, Instagram, text messages, and email within a writing session outside of the classroom. I also counted the number of times I reached for my phone, but didn't actually check it, because of my awareness of this data collection project. I collected data for five days, and the results were...as expected. I explain more about this data collection, plus some information on hyperbolic discounting and anti-procrastination software, in my "Explained Video" linked below. </p>

	<p>My data collection made me realize several things: I am addicted to technology. When I hear my phone <i>ding</i> or see a notification on my desktop, I cannot resist. I also noticed that I grew more frustrated when I became keenly aware of how much technology distracted me from getting my work done. I did test out some of the free anti-procrastination software I mentioned in the video, but I found that writing in a notebook only, with both my computer and phone put away, I was the most productive. However, I ran into problems of needing a thesaurus, dictionary, or scholarly article that I couldn't access without my computer or phone.</p>
